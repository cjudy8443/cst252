			we went through a step by step process of tlaking about the steps of playing

<p>4 Questions Answers:
<ol type= "1">1</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>Arrange your own 5 ships on a 10x10 grid, and leave them for the remainder of the game. </li>
		<li>Attempt to sink an opponent's ship by calling out squares where you think the enemy's ships are hiding.</li>
		<li>If location is valid to where the ship is, then the ship is hit. If location is not valid then the ship is not hit. </li>
		<li>Fire a bomb at a ship.</li>
	</ul>
<ol type= "2">2</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>Where you have already hit a boat. </li>
		<li>Player with the red kit goes first.</li>
	</ul>
<ol type= "3">3</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Take turns calling out squares.</li>
			<li>Continue the loop until all sections and ships have been hit.</li>
		</ul>
<ol type= "4">4</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>When it is your turn, after you hit a ship, where to hit next to take down the ship.</li>
		</ul>
</p>
<p>Our Pseudocode Steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Place your boats on your side. Once both opponents have placed boats, the
			player with the red kit goes first and guesses the location/square of where
			they think the ship is. If a ship is in that square, it is hit, if it is not,
			then it is not hit. Repeat until all of a player's ships are hit meaning they lost.</li>
